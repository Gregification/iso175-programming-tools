# iso175-programming-tools
programming tools to program the iso175. A jumble of miscellaneous software that I found/made to help with the task.

- instructions are in the "howto.txt" file.
    - the text refrences a "CANdaptor" tool, it simpily just reads and
     transmits can messages. it is not necessary, just handy.
- please read the header comments of any file in this repo, it is not well maintained.
- the referenced arduino is the Adafruit Feather M4 CAN (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5724). its only used as for can tx/rx.
- the most handy piece of software is the IMD_ISO175_settings_fetcher_v1 , very useful for testing.
